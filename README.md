## Welcome to my FlixFixer (SuperUser Movies) Project!

This program is designed to make managing a local library of movie and TV files easier for enthusaists who enjoy collecting such media. 

It currently provides features such as; 
1. Metadata viewing so users can determine which movies are in their highest available definition
2. Video upscaling and compression: Even if a movie is not available in HD, use cutting edge algorithms to upscale and efficiently store the video with the click of a button!
3. Audio definition upscaling: Have a stellar surround sound system? Don't have any movies that can take advantage of it? No problem! Easily use metadata to calculate DTS-HD and up to Dolby Atmos audio fidelity!
